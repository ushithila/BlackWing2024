## How to Access our site
Simply go to https://ushithila.github.io/index.html or download all files in our github repository https://github.com/ushithila/ushithila.github.io.

## Inspiration
Over the past few years, there has been a rise in overconsumption in the fashion industry because of the passing and going of trends. Every few weeks, a new product is released and becomes popular online, leading to a cycle of people buying, using the product for a brief period of time, then moving on to the next big thing they see online. People want to stay trendy and fashionable, which leads to them purchasing products more frequently, contributing to more waste in landfills. We wanted to create a website that helps point people towards brands that are both eco-friendly and fashionable. 


## What it does
Sustain You showcases several brands and events that are centered around being sustainable, allowing users to explore their specific styles in a convenient place. Users can also learn more about how to be more environmentally conscious with some tips on our website. 


## How we built it
In the first stages, we drew out a rudimentary blueprint of our website and planned out how many web pages should be included. Additionally, we outlined what features we wanted to add to each web page, and then we started building Sustain You on Replit. We worked on assigned tasks and assisted each other out when needed. 


## Challenges we ran into
Getting started on building the website was one such challenge that we faced because there were many things that we needed to finish by the end of our deadline. However, as time passed by and we added more features and changed the style of the website, we grew closer to having a fleshed-out version of what Sustain You could be. Additionally, another challenge that came up during the website’s creation was having consistent formatting across all our web pages. We struggled a bit with getting the navigation bar on the other web pages to look the same as our home page’s navigation bar. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of Sustain You’s functionality and aesthetic, along with being able to include a variety of events along with brands on the website for different interests.
 
## What we learned
Through the course of creating Sustain You, we found many unique brands and events that we’ve never heard of before, along with what practices companies do to be environmentally conscious. This reinforced our beliefs in sustainability and inspired us to become more proactive in the world of sustainability. Additionally, during the process of making the website, we had to keep good time management in order to work together well. We also had to communicate effectively with one another to ensure that our project runs smoothly. We feel these skills can be easily translated into other aspects of our personal and professional lives.


## What's next for Sustain You
We would like to add more brands on Sustain You in a more efficient way instead of having to manually add them repetitively. This would save time on developing the website further and allow us to add more categories, such as a section for ethically made handbags or shoes and a section for bath products.
