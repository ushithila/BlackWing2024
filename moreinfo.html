    <b1> In some cases, it can be hard to incorporate sustainability in your day to day life because of the price points
      or not knowing where to start. That's why we're providing some tips down below and some resources if you want more
      information.
      <br>
      <br>
      1.) Quality over quantity: it's very understandable why you'd steer away from more expensive products for your
      style and turn towards cheaper brands. However, if you do save your money, you'll have pieces that'll last for
      years instead of just months or days.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.) Buy second hand or vintage items: It can be daunting at first to get started into thrifting, but once you do,
      you'll find some great gems to keep in your everyday wear!
      <br>
      <br>
      3.) Look closely at the about us sections: In many brands claiming to be eco friendly, there are some that give
      statistics and partner organizations, but there are others that don't list enough information to prove their
      claims. Use reviews from other websites to compare alongside their listed information to check if they really do
      stick to their mission statements.
      <br>
      <br>
      4.) Take care of your things: it doesn't matter if your item is of better quality or not; you should maintain them
      to keep their longevity so you replace them less.
